Note that the license does not permit making derivatives, but 'merely changing the
format is allowed. I assume that extracting intervals counts as 'merely changing the format', and is not a derivative. Both the original data and the extracted intervals
have therefore been included in this repository. For details on the extraction,
see the [notebook](../../notebooks/iemp_css.ipynb).
