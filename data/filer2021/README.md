The original data has been included in the directory [original-data](original-data).
The file [IOI_and_call_sequence_data.xlsx](original-data/IOI_and_call_sequence_data.xlsx) was not directly parseable by Pandas, so I manually exported it to [filer2021.csv](original-data/filer2021.csv), which is further preprocessed in the [notebook](../../notebooks/filer2021.ipynb).
